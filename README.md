This is a playground for Scala

# Basics
- Like JavaScript, `val` can not be re-assigned, `var` can.
- Methods is "functions of other languages"
- Functions is basically anonymous functions
- Unit is basically void
- Instances of case classes are immutable, and they are compared by value (unlike classes, whose instances are compared by reference).
- You can instantiate object without using class
- Traits are basically interfaces
